# ABOUT THIS REPO

This is an extension to [NSubstitute](http://nsubstitute.github.io/) that provides mocking of concrete methods (non-interface, non-abstract) and statics.

Once we figure out API and workflow, we'll document it here. Currently this project is experimental.

TODO:

    * Deal with warnings in all our dependencies (background: https://github.com/nsubstitute/NSubstitute/issues/310)
